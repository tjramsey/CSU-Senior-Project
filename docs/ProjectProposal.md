Problem Statement:

Ideally, gamers would have an opportunity to play games where the world is affected by the player but also not centered around the player. Unfortunately, most game worlds either fully surround what the player does or is just a story where no actual changes can happen to the world that was not pre-planned to happen at a certain time. The predictable outcomes within of this type of game lower the chances of the gamer playing the game again. As Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman put it, &quot;... it is crucial in a game that players don&#39;t know exactly how it will play out. If you knew who was going to win a game before it started, would you even bother to play?&quot; ( Salen &amp; Zimmerman, 2003, p. 174). To make outcomes unpredictable, propose a game where both players and non-playable characters&#39; (NPCs) choices and actions could affect the game world. As a result, every playthrough of the game would be different from the previous one, hence adding massive replay value.

Having a high replay value is crucial to the success of a video game. A game has increase replay value if the game world is affected by not only the actions and choices of the player but also the NPCs.

Project Description:

The project will be a game where both the player and NPCs can do things that change the game world in a good or bad way. NPCs and the player will both go to quest givers and quest boards to accept quests. With each quest depending on if it is completed or failed, results in consequence that bare big or small, and good or bad. Through the interactions between the player and the NPCs, it will become noticeable that the world has been changed in some way other than by the actions of the player. If an NPC takes on a quest that the player did not, and wether quest taken by NPCs and the player are failed or completed will add differences to almost every playthrough of the game.

The game will be developed using Unity and pre-made assets to provide more time for the actual programming since asset creation is more of a digital graphics field.

Proposed Implementation Language(s):

I chose C# as the implementation language since that is the language that Unity, which I will be using to complete my project, uses for developing video games.

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits:

The only libraries, packages, and development kits that I know I will be using will be the standard C# libraries and the Unity libraries connected to Visual Studio, for the coding of the game, and the standard unity assets package found on the unity store in order cut down on time used making assets.

Additional Software/Equipment Needed

- I will need Visual Studio to create the C# programs. I will be using this since it has specific libraries connected to Unity.
- If I need to create assets that are not already available. I will need modeling software such as Blender, or Maya.

Personal Motivation

I chose this project due to a few reasons. One reason that I chose this project is that I really enjoy the idea of creating video games, and the only video games that I have made were 2-Dimensional games, and a partial 3-Dimensional (3-D) game, using game maker, and the thought of creating a 3-D video game intrigues me. Along with being my like of creating video games I also have realized that a lot of games that I play eventually run out of enjoyable re-playability. Rogue-like dungeons keep changing the level layout and loot drops but, that is all it does. Some Role-playing games provide different choice pathways but you can eventually get through all of them. In some games, the only thing that changes when you replay it is your character build but the story stays the same. I wanted a game where it is constantly changing and not just around what the character does, I also want a game where the player can truthfully choose their pathway rather than what the programmer wants, unlike games such as Skyrim where you are always, no matter which playthrough the Dragonborn, destined to save the world. If a player does not want to follow along with a pre-determined route they should not have to, and that player should not be subject to a never-changing story that will eventually get boring.

Outline of Future Research Efforts

I will need to learn how to implement artificial intelligence (ai) in Unity, as well as animations for actions of characters, both player and NPC, and I will have to learn how to create a save-load feature for the game. I have already found a wonderful tutorial on creating a Role-playing game in Unity on YouTube and I will watch it and follow along.
