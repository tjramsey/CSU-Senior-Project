# Statement of Purpose

### Problem Statement
Ideally, people would have the opportunity to play games where the world is affected by the player but also not centered around the player. Unfortunately, most game worlds either fully surround what the player does or is just a story where no actual changes can happen to the world that was not pre-planned to happen at a certain time. The predictable outcomes within of this type of game lower the chances of the gamer playing the game again. As Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman put it, &quot;... it is crucial in a game that players don&#39;t know exactly how it will play out. If you knew who was going to win a game before it started, would you even bother to play?&quot; (Salen &amp; Zimmerman, 2003, p. 174). To make outcomes unpredictable, propose a game where both players and non-playable characters&#39; (NPCs) choices and actions could affect the game world. As a result, every playthrough of the game would be different from the previous one, hence adding massive replay value.

Having a high replay value is crucial to the success of a video game. A game has increase replay value if the game world is affected by not only the actions and choices of the player but also the NPCs.

# Project Requirements

| ID # | Type | Description | Rationale | Fit Criterion | Priority | Dep |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0001 | Functional | The game must allow the user to start the game | Allow the game to even begin | The player is now in the game | 1 |
| 0002 | Functional | The game must allow the user to control the player character | It is a single-player game so the user should be the player | The user input affects the player character | 1 | 0001 |
| 0003 | Functional | The game must allow the player to customize their character&#39;s looks | Players should be able to choose what they look like | In-game their character will look like what they choose. | 3 |
| 0004 | Functional | The game must allow the user to save the game | Continuation of game | Saved game state matches game state when the user saved the game. | 2 |
| 0004-1 | Security | Modifications to save files will be recorded and a non-modified un-editable backup of the save file should be created. | Some users like to modify their game and this would allow for them to revert back to an unmodified version. | Backup save file appears in the list of game saves | 3 | 0004 |
| 0005 | Functional | The game must allow for the user to select 1 of 3 difficulty modes (easy, normal, hard) | Different players prefer different levels of difficulty | Base stats and stat modifier values for NPCs and player are changed to pre-determined values for the difficulty | 2 |
| 0006 | Functional | The game must allow the user to change settings such as video settings, audio settings, and difficulty. | Players have different preferences when playing games | When a player changes the setting it is noticeable when they play the game | 2 | 0005 |
| 0007 | Functional | The game must allow the user to load a saved game | Continuation of the game | The game starts at the point where it was when the user saved the game | 2 | 0001 0004 |
| 0008 | Functional | The game must have a main menu to load game saves, change settings, and start a new game | Every video game needs a main menu in order to easily get to the actual game play they want to. | When the game application starts it first shows the main menu and a player can load a saved game, create a new game, or change the settings. | 1 | 0001 0004 0005 0006 0007|
| 0009 | Functional | The game must have multiple types of non-playable characters (NPCs), such as merchants, guards, farmers, fishermen, builders, soldiers, bandits, thieves, blacksmiths, alchemists, etc. | Game world will be empty without them. | Different types of NPCs show up. | 2 | 0005 |
| 0010 | Functional | The game must have a variety of items. These include things such as weapons, armor, food, potions, and miscellaneous items. | Every role-playing game needs a variety of items otherwise it can get boring. | Multiple types and variety of each type of items show up in the game | 2|
| 0011 | Functional | The game must provide the player and each NPC have an inventory to store items.| The player and NPCs need to store items | The player and NPCs will have space for items to be stored in. | 2 | 0009|
| 0012 | Functional | The game must allow the user to pick up items | Most traditional RPGs allow the player to pick up items | Once an item is picked up it will disappear from its position and end up in the inventory of the player | 2 | 0010 0011|
| 0013 | Functional | The game must allow the player to create weapons, armor, food, potions, and certain miscellaneous items. | Adds variety to play style, which increases replayability. | At each respective station, players can exchange crafting materials for a complete item. | 3 | 0002 0010 0011|
| 0014 | Functional | The game must allow characters to interact with each other | Without interactions, the game is literally useless | The player can do things such as talk or fight with NPCs, and NPCs do the same with other NPCs. | 2 | 0002 0005 |
| 0015 | Functional | The game must allow NPCs and Quest boards to give out quests | Quests give a goal to the player and add changes to the world when they get completed | Certain NPCs and quest boards will have a quest indicator above them and when interacting with them the player will see information about the quest. | 2 | 0014 |
| 0016 | Functional | The game must allow players and NPCs to accept quests | Quests give a goal to the player and add changes to the world when they get completed | Player and each NPC that can accept quest will have a log and the quest will appear on that log when they accept it and the quest giver will not give out the quest again unless it is failed | 2 | 0014 |
| 0017 | Functional | The game must have multiple locations | Adds diversity to the game | Multiple distinct locations appear in the game | 2 |
| 0018 | Functional | The game must have multiple weather effects | Adds diversity to the game | In the game, the weather will change over time, indicated by whether it is raining, sunny, cloudy, snowy, or windy. | 3 |
| 0019 | Functional | The game must have multiple types of vegetation | Adds diversity to the game | Different types of trees, bushes, flowers, and grasses will be in the game. | 3 |

| 0021 | Functional | The game must have a common currency such as coins | You need currency to buy things. | The player can obtain currency which can then be used in shops | 2 | 0010 |
| 0022 | Functional | The game must allow the player and NPCs to buy/sell property and items | Adds diversity and a money-making aspect to the game | Ownership of property or item goes to the buyer and if it&#39;s an item it goes into the inventory, while money exchanged goes to the seller. | 2 | 0010 0014 0021|
| 0023 | Functional | The game must allow the player to personalize their property | Adds diversity to the game | The player can change the structures on the property and the designation of the property (home, shop, etc). | 3 | 0010 0022 |
| 0024 | Functional | The game must display the player&#39;s stats to them | Allows players to keep track of what their stats are | The player can see their stats after opening up the stats page. | 2 | 0001 |
| 0025 | Functional | The game must allow the player to level up his or her stats | Players have different play styles | Once a player accumulates enough experience from actions and quest they can increase his or her stats some. | 3 | 0024 |
| 0026 | Functional | The game must detect collision between Objects | There needs to be collision between objects. | Objects should not pass through each other. | 1 |

# Challenges Overcome

From the start this project was a challenge.
1. I was working with a IDE I have never used, Unity.
2. I had to learn C# from scratch
3. 
4.
5.
6.

# Future Enhancements

1. Overhaul the Non-Player Characters
2. Move away from the code checking for certain things every frame, to only checking when a certain thing happens
3. Create my own character controller to implement both 3rd and 1st person modes.
4. Add a difficulty setting
5. Allow for changes in settings to allow for different levels of computers to be able to run the game
6. Add more items, npcs, enemies, places, missions.
7. Create an internal clock system so that the system time doesn't have to be used when running certain functions.
